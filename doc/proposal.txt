# Project work

In this exercise I would like to implement an interpretor which is capable of executing a simple functional source language.
The features of the language are interpreting the discrete numerical operations (+,-,*,/,%), handle lists and strings,
calling functions and recursion.
At the end this interpretor should be able to execute a sudoku solver written in the source lanuage.

# Implementation

The language for implementation will be Haskell. Parsec will be utilized for parsing the source language.
